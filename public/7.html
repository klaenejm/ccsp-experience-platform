    <h2>Intelligence Briefing: Cyber Tools to Achieve Our Goals</h2>
        <h3>While we reserve the right to respond to Illyrian attacks by all means available, both cyber and conventional military, we aim to be proportional in our response. We have a diverse cyber tool-kit at our disposal, including capabilities such as zero-day exploits (which are available upon approval). 
            We have been successful in prepositioning malware in Illyrian infrastructure that provides reconnaissance, and the potential for disruption, degradation, or destruction of their critical infrastructure. However, overall our capabilities and number of expert personnel across mission sets remain limited, so we must prioritize the use of our forces to specific missions and operations at any given time.</h3>
