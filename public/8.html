    <h2>Intelligence Briefing: Status Report on our Great Kingdom</h2>
        <h3>Our 2nd Cyber Brigade has engaged in a successful intelligence-gathering operation which has indicated that Illyria is developing significant cyber capabilities that may overmatch our own cyber forces, particularly our ability to protect our networks as well as engage in counter-cyber operations effectively. 
            This concludes your intelligence briefing.</h3>
