    <h1>Commander</h1>
    <h2>Intelligence Briefing: Our Goals</h2>
        <h3>Commander, this briefing also will explain the operational options at your disposal for achieving our goal to counter cyber operations undertaken by Illyrian forces as well as our plans to gain the initiative on them in cyberspace in order to create an environment where Illyria is responding to us, as opposed to us responding to Illyria in cyberspace. One of your mission sets is to reduce the impact of cyber attacks we are facing and begin to seize the initiative back from Illyrian cyber forces, who have been active against us and put them off-balance and more on-guard. We expect you to conduct cyber operations and design campaigns that will protect our systems and the Kingdom.</h3>
