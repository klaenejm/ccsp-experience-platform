    <h2>Operation Cyber Fortress</h2>
        <h3>The King has authorized you to commence a cyber campaign against Illyria with the objective of gaining significant intelligence about their cyber capabilities and use that intelligence to initiate cyber manipulation of their cyber capabilities to make them ineffective when Illyria actually seeks to deploy them against us. Your goal is to undermine covertly their malware research and development capacity.</h3>
