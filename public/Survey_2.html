        Short Answer: <br />
        In your final step of the scenario, you were given the following
        choices:
        <br />
        <br />
        Option 1) Suspend Operation Cyber Fortress and redeploy our cyber force
        to locating the intrusions against our Cyber Brigades, containing
        damage, and preventing further infiltration of our systems. <br />
        <br />
        Option 2) Continue with the mission set of Operation Cyber Fortress.
        <br />
        <br />
        Option 3) Execute a DDoS attack against the Ministry of Defense of the
        Kingdom of Illyria that will seek to slow, disrupt, or degrade their
        operations against us. <br />
        <br />
        Option 4) Activate our prepositioned wiper malware on the Illyrian Cyber
        Command network and destroy Illyrian malware databases. <br /><br />
        Option 5) Conclude that the Illyrian operations equate to an act of war
        and recommend to the King that we should respond with a declaration of
        war and retaliatory strikes, both cyber and conventional, against the
        Kingdom of Illyria. Why did you choose the option you selected in the
        final step of the scenario?
