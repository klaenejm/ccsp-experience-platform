      Status Report to Illyria: <br> Cyberspace threats against our Kingdom are growing. We have been forced to
      protect against cyber attacks that seek personal information about our
      decision-makers, government officials, and our military personnel. We have
      confirmed Illyrian cyber attacks against other countries that have
      included operations against government research and development programs.
      Our intelligence and national security agencies are concerned about
      Illyrian activities on our networks that, beyond intelligence-gathering,
      could position them in a crisis or war to undermine our ability to make
      decisions as a government and fight a war. Finally, we suspect that
      Illyria was behind the cyber operations that led to the theft of
      confidential documents and their subsequent posting on the Internet in an
      apparent effort to undermine our King's reputation and our peoples'
      confidence in core political and social institutions. These activities
      bear the hallmarks of Illyria and while we have internally attributed many
      of these attacks to them, we have not made an explicit external
      announcement to date.
