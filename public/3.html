        <h2>Intelligence Briefing: General Strategic Enviornment</h2>
            <h3>Although the two kingdoms are currently at peace, the Kingdom of Illyria, as you know, has been a long-term rival. 
                While the Kingdom of Illyria is richer and its economy stands at 13 trillion ducats, as opposed to 1 trillion ducats in Kingdom of Dardania, we have protected ourselves by being proactive in our security. The King regards cyberspace as a strategic environment through which we can advance Dardania's national interests.</h3>
