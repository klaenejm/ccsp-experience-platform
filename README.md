[Information About Front-end Development:]
- The design of the experience platform is created by first using Figma to test layout and functionality, and subsequently created manually with HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, and JavaScript. The application is created as a web page, using primarily HTML and CSS, while using JavaScript sparingly for functionality that is unobtainable using HTML or CSS alone. 

[Information About Back-end Data Collection:]
- JavaScript Object Notation, commonly known as JSON, is used for data retrieval on this project. JSONâ€™s primary purpose is to allow various web applications communicate with a server, returning data that is human-readable. When participants complete the experience platform, their responses will be written to a JSON file, which can be sent to an HTML Table or CSV format, which can be read in Microsoft Excel. 

- Communication between the web application and the server is possible using express.js, an open-source, back-end web application framework, Licensed through MIT.
